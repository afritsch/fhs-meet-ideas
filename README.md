About
-----

meet-ideas is a platform to share project-ideas and organize the resulting
projects. At the moment it is a closed platform for the Fachhochschule Salzburg
and only for the studypaths MultiMedia Technology and MultiMedia Arts.

It aims to provide a simple interface to create and find projects.

Projects have several related infos including status, description, teammembers with roles,
appointments and images. Visitors to the project pages can post comments.
Projects can also be followed. When something changes, the followers get a
notification email. Projects can also be searched and sorted by status and title.

Theres also a userlist showing users with and without projects. The users can
be searched and sorted by studypath and name.
